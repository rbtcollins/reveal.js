## Pip constraints


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


```
pip install -c constraints.txt projectname
```


### Reasons to

* Locks down the version of anything specified.
* Does **not** imply installation.
* Suitable for coordinated versions across many trees.


### Reasons not to

* Don't use pip
* Can't guarantee pip 7.1+



## Use pip 7+

* Wheel caching
* Constraints
* Declarative conditional dependencies



## Sprinting Primer

* Fun activity
* **You** can and should join in.


## For projects

* Bootstrap new contributors face to face
* Get those thorny we-should-really issues finally moving


## For attendees

* Get involved in a project you use/like/want to use
* Get direct support from experienced project members
* Scratch an itch thats been annoying you!

## How do you scale?

* Convice other people to do things <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* if everyone does this you end up with openstack

## Things I wish I'd know when I started developing

* Help folk understand the problem
* Agree on the shape of the solution before the implementation of the solution
* Delay deciding on everything you can until it actually matters
* Let folk decide as much as they can themselves
* automation is leverage. You only scale to the degree that you automate
  things. Being fast at writing code is at most linear. Automate say testing or
  deployments and you can replicate that 1000 times over.
